## Terrablocks

Terraform reusable [resource](https://www.terraform-best-practices.com/key-concepts#resource) modules.

### Adding a module
Please take a look at the official Terraform Module [Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/) first.
If the registered module is too complicated for Gengo's use, isn't verified or doesn't really suited for us, make a pull request.
